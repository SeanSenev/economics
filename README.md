Build US model economy from first principles 

Authors : Sean Seneviratne , Arjun Krishnan

Our goal in this repo is to develop elementary models that describe the US economy. We hope to start with GDP where the GDP is equal to consumer spending
plus government expenditure plus investments plus net exports. This one equation simply describes the economy at large.

We'll pull data for each component from reputable sources and aggregate them to a table from which we can determine GDP.
